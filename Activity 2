Lists and for loops
Use the lists below to solve the following exercise questions. Make sure you run this cell before you begin with the activity or you will run into errors.

0s
professions = ['married', 'laborer', 'widow', 'widow', 'laborer' ]
gender = ['woman', 'man', 'woman', 'woman', 'man']
longlist_professions = ['married', 'married', 'laborer', 'laborer', 'widow', 'married', 'spinster',
                     'laborer', 'spinster', 'laborer', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'married', 'laborer',
                     'laborer', 'spinster', 'laborer', 'laborer', 'laborer', 'laborer', 'laborer', 'spinster',
                     'laborer', 'spinster', 'widow', 'spinster', 'painter', 'laborer', 'weaver', 'laborer']
Extract the second item in the list professions.

Hint: Python begins indexing from '0.' The first item, 'married,' is position [0].

'laborer'

Make a for loop that considers each item in the professions list and prints “Person’s profession is ___.”

[77]
0s
professions = ['married', 'laborer', 'widow', 'widow', 'laborer' ]
for profession in professions:
    print(f"Person's profession is {profession}")
                                    
Person's profession is married
Person's profession is laborer
Person's profession is widow
Person's profession is widow
Person's profession is laborer
Using a list method, add an item to the list gender called “not known”

[40]
0s
gender= ['woman', 'man','woman','woman','man']
gender.append("not known")
Make a for loop that considers each item in the gender list and prints “Person identifies as a man” if the person is registered as a man, “Person identifies as a woman” if the person registered as a woman, and “Person’s gender is not known” if person's gender is unknown.

[106]
0s
gender= ['woman','man','woman','woman','man']
gender.append("not known")
for gender in gender:
  if gender == "man":
    print(f"Person identifies as a man")
    if gender == "woman":
      print(f"Person identifies as a woman")
      if gender == "not known" :
        print(f"Person's gender is not known")
Person identifies as a man
Person identifies as a man
Build a new list called spinster_list that includes only the items in the list longlist_professions that matches spinster.

Hint: You will need to create an empty list variable before sorting the list with a for loop.


[107]

spinster_list=[]
for profession in longlist_professions:
  if profession == "spinster":
    spinster_list.append(profession)
    print(spinster_list)

['spinster', 'spinster']
['spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster']
['spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster']
['spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster']
['spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster']
['spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster']
['spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster', 'spinster']

Find the most and least common professions in the list longlist_professions.
Run the cell below to import the Counter module and use the appropriate method.

Hint: You will need to create a variable for the results of the Counter function before running the method.
Hint 2: Check your spelling. Python is case-sensitive, and the function for Counter begins with a capital C.

--- There were actually more than two erros here. The first error was that (if) and (else) were not needed. The second error was that job is not a singular word for professions. It would just be profession; therefore, I would need to replace job for profession. The third error was that instead of using "print(f"Wow, women were limited to their martial status such as job")", all i needed to do was delete it and replace it with "print(f"Person's profession is laborer").

Defining functions
Make a function called hello that greets the user with "Hello {person}! Have a good day ahead." Test your function to make sure it runs as intended.

Hint: You will need one parameter in the function.

def hello(person):

Make a function called sum_of_3 that allows the user to add 3 numbers. Test your function to make sure it runs as intended.
Level-up challenge: Use a default argument to prevent code failing if the user has less than 3 input.

Make a function called fahrenheit_to_celsius that converts the temperature in fahrenheit to celsius. Call your function to test that it runs as intended.

Hint: The formula for converting the temperature is (Temperature in Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.
