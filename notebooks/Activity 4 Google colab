The python scripts we got to learn about were conditionals, comparisons, string methods, loops, functions, version control, data cleaning, data collection, data analysis, and text analysis. One python script that I would like to talk about is functions. Now, what exactly is a command? A python command is a behavioral design pattern that converts requests or simple operation into objects. Functions are what runs a command due to it being the way of building up a code to perform specific tasks. Functions are also useful because it organizes your code very well and stops you from repeating a code over and over again. Examples of built-in-python functions are “print(), len(), and type()”; what this does is help determine or define what is being commanded. Below, I will be making a tutorial of a function; therefore, it can give you an example of how to use functions.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"a7YSKxfDyCDc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Tutorial"],"metadata":{"id":"zqej4OqqynFC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### If you were to make a function of asking you friend out, you would first type the word “def” and then “ask_your_crush_out”"],"metadata":{"id":"2PSYTMZHztWs"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def ask_your_crush_out"],"metadata":{"id":"jgjU4mcS7gWq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### What does the word def mean?\n","\n","### The word Def is short for define which means you are defining the function."],"metadata":{"id":"Q_M_LgUR8FcZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","# After tying this you would need to use the word print and then type what exactly you are going to ask and tell your friend\n","\n","### Note: “Print()” helps display the text on your screen or display what exactly you are going to type or say on your screen. *"],"metadata":{"id":"u4OP1oZq84Ps"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Def ask_your_crush_out\n","   Print(\"Hey, I have been knowing you for such a long time.\")\n","   Print(\"Things about us has been on my mind lately.\")\n","   Print(\"I wanted to know if I could take you on a date?\")\n","   Print(“I'll let you know what I've been thinking about only if your willing to go.\")\n","   Print(“Please?”)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"24mvn-wy9mlq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Note: Make sure that you indent or else an error will appear and the function would not be defined.\n","\n","# After typing this, the next thing you would need to do is type in return under the function: therefore, you can make a return statement\n","\n","# What is a return statement?\n","# A return statement executes the function that needs to be defined by putting what needs to be said out there by writing it in full sentences without built-in python functions being included."],"metadata":{"id":"fhH4SfCJ_Mn7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[" Def ask_your_crush_out\n","    Print(\"Hey, I have been knowing you for such a long time.\")\n","    Print(\"Things about us has been on my mind lately.\")\n","    Print(\"I wanted to know if I could take you on a date?\")\n","    Print(\"I’ll let you know what I’ve been thinking about only if your willing to go.\")\n","    Print(\"Please?\")\n","    return\n"],"metadata":{"id":"s4O8g7I-ABkn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Now, that you have done this python now has and idea of what needs to be said once you type “ask_your_crush_out()” then it will type out what you would want say to your crush\n","\n","\n","           \n"],"metadata":{"id":"TZ78H2DrB6jb"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ask_your_crush_out()"],"metadata":{"id":"rj4bzFYpE37a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["  Answer:\n","  \n","  Hey, I’ve been knowing you for such a long time.

A parameter is when a variable is listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. It acts as a placeholder for the values that will be passed onto the function when it is called. The value being passed onto the function when it is called is called a parameter. Once it is called it would provide the function information it needs in order to complete the task."],"metadata":{"id":"442zdse-IL9w"}}]}
