Activity two was something that took me a long time to do due to my depression. However, when I did it, it kind of felt easy to do. It was mostly hard, which tells me that I need to study more, especially for finals. Studying more would prepare me for more challenges within this course. The only reason why I felt I did good was because I had searched melanie walsh's guide on the basics of python and focused what was on this assignment which was python’s lists and loops, dictionaries and functions. If I didn’t do research on this I probably would’ve failed this assignment. Overall, this was a pretty good challenge because it made me become aware of errors; furthermore, let me know how to properly define a function for each question. The easiest question for this activity was question number two, it literally gave me the answer itself.
